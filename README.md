Save the animals! This datapack provides vegan* recipes for the following mob drops:

- Ink sacs (and black dye)
- Glow ink sacs
- Rabbit hide (use to create leather)
- Rabbit foot
- Cod
- Salmon
- Pufferfish
- Tropical fish
- Feathers
- Bones (using bone meal from a composter)
- String

It also contains the classic wool to string and rotten flesh to leather recipes.

*All base components can be made without animal drops. Example: For leather, you need four rabbit hide. Craft rabbit hide with paper, string and honeycomb. Use wheat to craft the string, and honey blocks (made from honey bottles, which are made with sugar, small flowers and water bottles) and bone meal (from a composter) to craft the honeycomb.
